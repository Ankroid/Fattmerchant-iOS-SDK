/// ## Example usage with Tokenization
/// ```
/// // With tokenization
/// let amount = Amount(cents: 1999) // $19.99
/// let request = TransactionRequest(amount: amount)
/// ```
/// ## Sample without Tokenization
/// ```
/// // Without tokenization
/// let amount = Amount(cents: 1999) // $19.99
/// let request = TransactionRequest(amount: amount, tokenize: false)
/// ```
/// ## Charging a card without a mobile reader
/// ```
/// // With given card
/// let card = CreditCard(personName: "Joan Parsnip", cardNumber: "4111111111111111", cardExp: "1230", addressZip: "32822")
