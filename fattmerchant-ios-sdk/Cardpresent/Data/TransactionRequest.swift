/// ```
/// // With tokenization
/// let amount = Amount(cents: 1999) // $19.99
/// let request = TransactionRequest(amount: amount)
/// ```
/// ## Sample without Tokenization
/// ```
/// // Without tokenization
/// let amount = Amount(cents: 1999) // $19.99
/// let request = TransactionRequest(amount: amount, tokenize: false)
/// ```
